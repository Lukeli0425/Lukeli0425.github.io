I'm currently working as an intern at Tsinghua Visual Intelligence and Computational Imaging Lab [(Luvision)](http://www.luvision.net) under the directions of Prof. [Lu Fang](http://www.luvision.net/show-684.html). I'm working on an optical system featuring DNN that is able to cope with multiples tasks of computer vision based on Meta-learning at the moment.
