### About

I'm an undergraduate student at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University. I'm currently working as an intern at Tsinghua Visual Intelligence and Computational Imaging Lab [(Luvision)](luvision.net) under the directions of Prof. Lu Fang. I'm working on an optical system featuring DNN that is able to cope with multiples tasks of computer vision based on Meta-learning at the moment. I finished my high school at Beijing No.4 High School.
