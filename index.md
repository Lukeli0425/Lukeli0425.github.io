# About

I'm an undergraduate student at [Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I'm currently working as an intern at Tsinghua Visual Intelligence and Computational Imaging Lab [(Luvision)](http://www.luvision.net) under the directions of Prof. [Lu Fang](http://www.luvision.net/show-684.html). I received a high school diploma at [Beijing No.4 High School](http://bhsf.lezhiyun.com/cms/) in 2019.

# Projects

Check out my projects on [Github](https://github.com/Lukeli0425?tab=repositories)!

## [Video Editing Based on Rhythm Matching](https://github.com/Lukeli0425/THUEE-SS-Project2021)

This is my implemention of 2021 **_Signals and Systems_** course project. The main task is to build an algorithm that creates an video from a given set of video clips and an background music so that the video clips matches the background music in terms of audio rhythm as best as possible. This project is built with Matlab.

## [Video-Audio Signal Processing](https://github.com/Lukeli0425/VASP)

This is my implemention of the course project for **_Introduction to Auditory-visual Information System_**. I built three algorithms that solves the the following problems respectively:

1. Recognize faces from videos clips.
2. Recongizes voices from audios.
3. Given a video of three speakers speaking at the same time, separate the speeches from the three speakers.

This project is realized in Python with the aid of [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition), [Resemblyzer](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer) and [Speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain).

## [Stock Forecast with GPR](https://github.com/Lukeli0425/Stock-Forecast-with-GPR)

This is my implemention of the course project for **_Stochastic Processes_**. I built an algorithm using Guassian Process Regression that preditcs the stock prices based on previous observations. The project is implemented with Python and [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html?highlight=sklearn.gaussian_process#module-sklearn.gaussian_process).
