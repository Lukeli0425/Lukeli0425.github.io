### [Video-Audio Signal Processing](https://github.com/Lukeli0425/VASP)

This is my course project of **_Introduction to Auditory-visual Information System_**. I built three algorithms that solves the the following problems respectively:

1. Recognize faces from videos clips.
2. Recongizes voices from audios.
3. Given a video of three speakers speaking at the same time, separate the speeches from the three speakers.

This project is implemented in Python with the aid of [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition), [Resemblyzer](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer) and [Speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain). -->

### [Astro Image Processing](https://github.com/Lukeli0425/Astro-Image-Processing)

This repo contains my code and data for astronomical image reduction. The images were taken at Huairou, Beijing with a 25cm telescope of [DoA](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn). Targets includes M13, M51, M3, etc.

### [Stock Forecast with GPR](https://github.com/Lukeli0425/Stock-Forecast-with-GPR)

This is my course project of **_Stochastic Processes_**. I built an algorithm using Guassian Process Regression that preditcs the stock prices based on previous observations. This project is implemented with Python and [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html?highlight=sklearn.gaussian_process#module-sklearn.gaussian_process).

### [Video Editing Based on Rhythm Matching](https://github.com/Lukeli0425/THUEE-SS-Project2021)

This is my 2021 **_Signals and Systems_** course project. The main task is to build an algorithm that creates an video from a given set of video clips and a background music so that the video clips matches the background music in terms of audio rhythm as best as possible. This project is built with Matlab.
