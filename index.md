<img src="./images/luke_profile.jpg" width=200 align=right><img/>

<p>
I'm a junior undergraduate student majoring in <a href="https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en">Electronic Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>, interested in <b>computational imaging</b> and <b>computer vision</b>. I'm currently working with Prof. <a href="https://www.alexander.vision">Emma Alexander</a> from <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu">Northwestern University</a>. I was an intern at the <a href="http://www.luvision.net">Tsinghua Visual Intelligence and Computational Imaging Lab</a>. I graduated from <a href="http://bhsf.lezhiyun.com/cms/">Beijing No.4 High School</a> in 2019.

## [Video-Audio Signal Processing](https://github.com/Lukeli0425/VASP)

This is my course project of **_Introduction to Auditory-visual Information System_**. I built three algorithms that solves the the following problems respectively:

1. Recognize faces from videos clips.
2. Recongizes voices from audios.
3. Given a video of three speakers speaking at the same time, separate the speeches from the three speakers.

<div align=center><img src="./images/vasp_demo.png" width=600><img/></div>

This project is implemented in Python with the aid of [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition), [Resemblyzer](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer) and [Speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain).

## [Astro Image Processing](https://github.com/Lukeli0425/Astro-Image-Processing)

This repo contains my code and data for astronomical image reduction. The images were taken at Huairou, Beijing with a 25cm telescope of [DoA](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn). Targets includes M13, M51, M3, etc, which are to be supplemented.

## [Stock Forecast with GPR](https://github.com/Lukeli0425/Stock-Forecast-with-GPR)

This is my course project of **_Stochastic Processes_**. I built an algorithm using Guassian Process Regression that preditcs the stock prices based on previous observations. This project is implemented with Python and [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html?highlight=sklearn.gaussian_process#module-sklearn.gaussian_process).

## [Video Editing Based on Rhythm Matching](https://github.com/Lukeli0425/THUEE-SS-Project2021)

This is my 2021 **_Signals and Systems_** course project. The main task is to build an algorithm that creates an video from a given set of video clips and an background music so that the video clips matches the background music in terms of audio rhythm as best as possible. This project is built with Matlab.
